- **DB_HOST** / **DB_PORT**: RDS endpoint and port.  
- **DB_NAME**: Name of your MySQL database.  
- **DB_CHARSET**: Character set configuration (utf8mb4 recommended).  
- **DB_PARSE_TIME**: Enables time parsing in MySQL responses.  
- **DB_TLS_MODE**: Controls TLS verification (verify-full or verify-ca).

## üö¢ Deployment to AWS

Below is a concise guide for running **TestifyApp** on an **AWS EC2** instance with a secure connection to **AWS RDS MySQL**.

### 1. Prepare the AWS Environment

1. **AWS RDS**  
   - Create a MySQL instance on AWS RDS.  
   - Configure two Security Groups:  
     - **WebTestifySG**: Allows inbound HTTP (port 80) from anywhere.  
     - **DBTestifySG**: Allows inbound MySQL traffic (port 3306) only from WebTestifySG.

2. **AWS EC2**  
   - Launch an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux or Ubuntu).  
   - Associate it with **WebTestifySG**.  
   - Set up or upload an EC2 key pair and download the **.pem** file.

### 2. Build the Go Application

Compile your Go code for Linux by running:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bootstrap
```

This will produce a Linux-compatible binary named **bootstrap**.

### 3. Transfer Files to EC2

Securely copy the compiled binary, TLS certificate, and **.env** file to your EC2 instance.

1)
   ```bash
   scp -i ~/.ssh/WebTestifyAppKP.pem bootstrap ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:
   ```
   Copies the **bootstrap** file (your Go binary).

2)
   ```bash
   scp -i ~/.ssh/WebTestifyAppKP.pem certs/rds-ca-global-bundle.pem ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:
   ```
   Transfers the RDS CA certificate for TLS.
3)
   ```bash
   scp -i ~/.ssh/WebTestifyAppKP.pem .env ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:
   ```
   Uploads your environment variables.

Replace **~/.ssh/WebTestifyAppKP.pem** with the path to your actual key pair, and **<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>** with your instance‚Äôs public IP or DNS.

### 4. Launch the Application

After transferring your files:

1) SSH into the EC2 instance (if not already):
   ```bash
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/WebTestifyAppKP.pem
   ```
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/WebTestifyAppKP.pem ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
   ```

2) Navigate to the directory containing your files (e.g., **cd ~/** if placed in the home directory).

3) Make the binary executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x bootstrap
   ```

4) Run the application (with sudo if needed):
   ```bash
   sudo ./bootstrap
   ```

Access your app at **http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>** to confirm it is running.
